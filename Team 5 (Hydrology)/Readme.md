### Solution 1: Risk zone mapping
**Description:** We filtered out the datasets, keeping only the maximum values of water levels from each month, and one particular river tributary (in our case, Bagmati at the stations: Khokana, Raigaun, Sundarijal bridge, Bhorleni), and plotted the values in the graph. We also highlighted the risk zones from which the users could check if their houses fall on them.

### Solution 2: (Underway) Creating a Twitter bot alert
**Description:** We are creating a twitter bot that would check all the datasets from our realtime API, and post an alert tweet whenever the current level of water reaches the warning threshold for that particular river tributary.
